        <p class="f3 1h-copy txt">
          We welcome others to our home as a way of getting to know each other and of recognizing each other, a bright line in the paths we follow. We receive people from far-flung places, setting a course together, weaving emotional ties, and perhaps even becoming partners in crime.
        </p>

        <p class="f3 1h-copy txt">
          Receiving people at our homes is a common practice in this territory. We receive people for eating, for celebrating, for saying farewell, for death’s arrival as well as life’s arrival. We receive people for playing and we even receive them unexpectedly. But in this instance we want to generate and to nurture a creative process among all, and to share this process with others. Welcoming people simply for the sake of welcoming more people.

      <h1 class="f-2 1h-title fw7 txt"> Guidelines</h1>
      <p class="f3 1h-copy">
        To receive people we will lay down some rules:
        </p>
      <p class="f3 1h-copy">
        → We will open up our process for discussion.<br>
        → We will give working hours to our collaborators.<br>
        → We will take care of ourselves and of everyone involved in the process.<br>
        → We will be attentive to social differences and be open to change.
      </p>
      <p class="f3 1h-copy">
        With these rules, we will build together a temporary shelter, taking care of each other so that we can move forward or backward or to the side, but in any case wherever we need to go.
